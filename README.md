# useful_scripts

A lot of these scripts are originally written by others, I use them frequently and so they are modified for my usage!

extended_QC_CIVET.sh :

It is to generate QC files with overlaying brain surfaces on T1 images.

example

```bash
./extended_QC_CIVET.sh CC220713 /data4/yzeighami/CamCAN_civet_beluga/CamCAN_beluga_CIVET_211/CC220713 /tmp/
```

LP_clp_to_CIVET_t1t2_ratio.sh:

....

example:

```bash
./LP_clp_to_CIVET_t1t2_ratio.sh /data4/yzeighami/CamCAN_civet_beluga/CamCAN_beluga_CIVET_211 /data4/yzeighami/CamCAN_Long_Mahsa/LP_2013 CC220526
